# PubMed-Fetch-Research-Papers
## Overview
This project involves the development of a Python-based tool to fetch research papers
from PubMed using its API. The tool filters papers with at least one author affiliated
with a pharmaceutical or biotech company and saves the results in a CSV file. The
goal is to streamline the process of identifying relevant scientific articles for industryrelated research.
